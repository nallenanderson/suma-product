# Lean Sprint Tracking
**Development Phase - Core Artifact**

---

## Sprint Information
- **Sprint #:** 1 of 4
- **Duration:** August 15 - August 29, 2025 (2 weeks)
- **Owner:** Roberto Silva (Engineering Lead)
- **Team:** Roberto Silva (Backend), Ana Morales (Frontend), Carlos Ruiz (Full-stack)

---

## Sprint Goal & Commitment

**Primary Goal:** Complete contractor management foundation with RUT validation and basic CRUD operations

**Business Value:** Enable finance managers to register and manage contractors digitally, replacing manual spreadsheets and reducing onboarding time from 15 minutes to 2 minutes per contractor

**Success Criteria:** Demo working contractor registration with live SII RUT validation to beta customer (Constructora del Sur)

### Committed Work
| Story | Priority | Points | Assignee | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Set up contractor database schema | Critical | 5 | Roberto | Done |
| Create contractor registration API | Critical | 8 | Roberto | In Progress |
| Build contractor management UI | Critical | 13 | Ana | To Do |
| Integrate SII RUT validation service | Critical | 8 | Carlos | In Progress |
| Add contractor search and filtering | High | 5 | Ana | To Do |
| **Total Committed** | | **39 SP** | | |

### Team Capacity
**Available Capacity:** 42 story points (3 devs Ã— 14 SP capacity)  
**Capacity Adjustments:** Ana has 1 day PTO on August 22  
**Utilization Target:** 85-90%

## Progress Tracking

### Daily Status (Update Each Day)
**Current Day:** Wednesday - August 21, 2025  
**Sprint Progress:** 45% complete (22 SP remaining of 39 SP)  
**On Track:** Yes - Database schema completed ahead of schedule, API development progressing well  
**Blockers:** None - SII test environment access confirmed

### Weekly Check-in (Mid-Sprint)
**Completed This Week:**
- Database schema implemented with contractor, retention_rules, and audit_log tables
- SII RUT validation research completed - API endpoint identified and test account configured
- Initial contractor registration API endpoints (POST /contractors, GET /contractors/:id)

**Risks/Issues:**
- SII API rate limiting (60 requests/minute) - Implementing request queuing for bulk operations
- Contractor UI complexity higher than estimated - May need to simplify for MVP

**Forecast:** On track - Should complete all Critical stories, may defer High search functionality to Sprint 2

## Quality Gates

### Testing Status
| Test Type | Target | Current | Status |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|
| Unit Tests | >80% | 85% | âœ… |
| Integration Tests | All Critical stories | 2 of 3 | ðŸŸ¡ |
| Security Scan | 0 Critical | 0 issues | âœ… |

### Critical Quality Checks (Boleta/Contractor)
- [x] **RUT Validation Accuracy:** SII integration tested with valid/invalid RUTs
- [x] **Data Security:** Contractor PII encrypted at rest (AES-256)  
- [ ] **Performance:** Response times <3 seconds (pending API completion)
- [x] **Compliance:** Audit trail logging implemented for contractor changes

### Bug Status
**Critical Bugs:** 0 (Target: 0)  
**High Bugs:** 1 - UI validation message not displaying properly  
**New Bugs This Sprint:** 1

## Key Dependencies & Risks

### External Dependencies
| Dependency | Status | Owner | Impact if Delayed |
|------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| SII RUT validation API access | Complete | SII Technical Team | None - access confirmed |
| Beta customer feedback session | Scheduled Aug 29 | John Doe (PM) | Demo delay but no development impact |

### Top Risks
1. **SII API Rate Limiting:** Probability: Medium - Implementing request queuing and caching for bulk operations
2. **UI Complexity for Contractor Management:** Probability: Low - Simplifying design, focusing on core workflow
3. **RUT Validation Edge Cases:** Probability: Medium - Testing with various RUT formats and invalid scenarios

## Sprint Review & Retrospective

### Demo Preparation
**Demo Date:** August 29, 2025  
**What We'll Show:**
1. Contractor Registration Flow - Complete registration with live SII RUT validation
2. Contractor Management Dashboard - View/edit contractor profiles and status

**Demo Environment:** Staging with SII test environment

### Sprint Results
**Velocity:** 36 story points completed (vs 39 committed)  
**Goal Achievement:** Met - Core contractor management functional with SII integration  
**Quality:** Good - All security and performance requirements met

### Retrospective (Complete at Sprint End)
**What Went Well:**
- SII API integration smoother than expected
- Database schema design accommodated all contractor types without changes
- Team collaboration excellent, good knowledge sharing on Chilean tax requirements

**What to Improve:**
- UI story estimation was too optimistic - need more detailed design review in planning
- Should have included more buffer time for SII integration testing

**Action Items for Next Sprint:**
1. **Include design review in planning process** - Ana Morales - Priority: High
2. **Add 20% buffer to integration stories** - Roberto Silva - Priority: Medium

## Next Sprint Preview

### Carry-Over Work
| Story | Reason Not Completed | Remaining Effort |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| Add contractor search and filtering | Prioritized core registration flow | 5 SP |

### Next Sprint Focus
**Planned Theme:** Boleta processing and 10% tax retention calculations  
**Key Dependencies:** Contractor management API complete (on track)  
**Team Changes:** None
