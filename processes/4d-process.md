## Phase 1: Discovery
**Owner:** UX Research & Product Manager  
**Duration:** 2-4 weeks  
**Objective:** Validate market problems and identify opportunities

The Discovery phase forms the foundation of our product development process, where we transition from assumptions to validated insights about market opportunities and customer needs. This phase is particularly critical in our market, where SMBs face complex, interconnected challenges that require deep understanding of their operational workflows, compliance requirements, and growth constraints. Our UX Research team leads comprehensive market analysis while Product Managers focus on business viability and strategic alignment.

During this phase, we employ a mixed-methods research approach that combines quantitative market data with qualitative customer insights. We analyze industry trends, regulatory changes (such as tax law updates or new reporting requirements), and competitive movements that could impact SMB operations. We conduct in-depth customer interviews, observing actual workflows and pain points in real business environments. This dual approach ensures we understand both the broader market context and the specific, day-to-day challenges our target customers face when managing their business operations, payroll processing, or financial reporting.

The Discovery phase concludes with a **validated problem statement that clearly articulates the opportunity size, target customer segments, and business impact potential**. We establish measurable success criteria and ensure alignment across all stakeholders before moving to the Definition phase. This rigorous validation process _significantly reduces the risk of building features that don't address real market needs_ and ensures our development resources are _focused on high-impact opportunities_ that will drive customer adoption and business growth.

### Key Activities
- **Market Research:** Competitive analysis, industry trends, regulatory requirements
- **Customer Research:** User interviews, surveys, analytics review
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Internal workshops and/or business case validation
- **Problem Validation:** Evidence gathering, hypothesis formation

## Phase 2: Definition
**Owner:** Product Manager & Engineering Lead  
**Duration:** 3-5 weeks  
**Objective:** Define solution scope and technical approach

The Definition phase **transforms validated market opportunities** into concrete, actionable product specifications that balance customer needs with technical feasibility and business constraints. This collaborative phase requires tight partnership between Product Managers, who maintain customer advocacy and business alignment, and Engineering Leads, who ensure technical viability and architectural integrity. 

During Definition, we create comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that specify not just what we're building, but how it fits into the broader ecosystem of SMB business tools. This includes defining APIs for third-party integrations (banks, payment processors, tax authorities), establishing data migration strategies for existing customer systems, and outlining compliance frameworks for financial reporting standards. Our Engineering Leads conduct thorough technical feasibility assessments, evaluating system performance impacts, security implications, and scalability requirements. We also establish clear boundaries between MVP functionality and future enhancements, ensuring we can deliver value quickly while building toward a comprehensive long-term vision.

The Definition phase concludes with a detailed project plan that includes realistic timelines, resource allocation, and risk mitigation strategies. All stakeholders — from engineering teams to customer success — review and approve the specifications before development begins. This thorough planning phase prevents scope creep, reduces development cycles, and ensures everyone understands both the technical requirements and business objectives. By investing time in comprehensive definition, we minimize costly changes during development and deliver solutions that truly meet customer needs while maintaining our high standards for reliability and performance.

### Key Activities

## Phase 3: Development
**Owner:** Engineering Lead & Product Manager  
**Duration:** 2-8 weeks (varies by complexity)  
**Objective:** Build and test the solution

The Development phase represents the execution of our planned solution, where Engineering Leads drive technical implementation while Product Managers ensure continued alignment with customer needs and business objectives. This phase follows agile methodologies with 2-week sprints, allowing for iterative feedback and course corrections while maintaining momentum toward delivery. 

Throughout development, we maintain rigorous quality standards through comprehensive testing protocols that go beyond standard software practices. Our teams conduct thorough security audits, performance testing under realistic SMB transaction volumes, and user acceptance testing with actual customers to ensure the solution works seamlessly in real-world business scenarios. We also implement robust monitoring and logging systems to track system performance and quickly identify any issues that could impact customer operations.

The Development phase emphasizes continuous collaboration between engineering and product teams, with daily standups, weekly sprint reviews, and ongoing stakeholder communication to ensure we're building exactly what was defined while adapting to any technical discoveries or customer feedback. We maintain detailed documentation throughout development, including API specifications, database schemas, and deployment procedures, ensuring knowledge transfer and long-term maintainability. By the end of this phase, we have a thoroughly tested, documented, and validated solution ready for customer deployment, with all security and compliance requirements met and performance benchmarks achieved.

### Key Activities

## Phase 4: Delivery
**Owner:** Product Manager & Customer Success  
**Duration:** 2-4 weeks  
**Objective:** Launch solution and measure impact

The Delivery phase transforms our thoroughly tested solution into customer value through strategic rollout, comprehensive training, and continuous impact measurement. Product Managers orchestrate the launch strategy alongside Marketing, while Customer Success teams focus on adoption, training, and feedback collection to ensure customers realize the full value of our solutions. This phase is particularly critical for products, where implementation often requires careful data migration, process changes within customer organizations, and compliance validation — all of which must be executed flawlessly to maintain customer trust and operational continuity.

Our delivery approach emphasizes gradual, monitored rollouts that minimize risk while maximizing learning opportunities. We typically begin with a controlled beta release to select customers who can provide detailed feedback, followed by gradual expansion to broader customer segments. During this process, our teams provide hands-on implementation support, conducting training sessions where necessary, creating customized documentation, and establishing success metrics for each customer deployment. We maintain close monitoring of system performance, customer adoption rates, and support ticket volumes to quickly identify and address any issues that could impact customer satisfaction or business operations.

The Delivery phase concludes with comprehensive impact analysis that validates our initial success criteria and identifies opportunities for iteration and improvement. We track key metrics including customer adoption rates, feature utilization, support ticket resolution times, and customer satisfaction scores to ensure our solution is delivering measurable business value. This data-driven approach enables us to quickly identify successful patterns for broader rollout as well as areas needing refinement for future releases. By maintaining this feedback loop throughout delivery, we ensure that each product launch strengthens our relationship with customers while providing valuable insights for our next development cycle.
