# Roadmap Management Process
**Strategic Product Planning Framework**

---

## Overview

This process establishes standardized roadmap management across our three SaaS companies, ensuring strategic alignment while maintaining the agility needed for competitive ERP/payroll/accounting solutions. Our dual-horizon approach balances long-term vision with tactical execution through rolling 12-month high-level roadmaps and detailed quarterly execution plans.

**Benefits of this process:**
- **Strategic Alignment:** Ensures product development supports business objectives across all companies
- **Resource Optimization:** Enables effective capacity planning and cross-company resource sharing (CloudOps and Security)
- **Market Responsiveness:** Provides framework for adapting to regulatory changes and competitive pressures
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Creates predictable planning cycles for sales, customer success, and executive teams
- **Investment Prioritization:** Data-driven framework for feature prioritization and resource allocation
