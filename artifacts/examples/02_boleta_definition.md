## User Stories & Requirements

### Primary User Persona
**SMB Finance Manager (Contractor-Heavy Industries)**
- **Goals:** Process boletas quickly and accurately, ensure SII compliance, maintain good contractor relationships
- **Key Pain Points:** Manual tax calculations, SII reporting complexity, contractor payment delays, error-prone Excel workflows

### Core User Stories

#### Epic 1: Contractor Management & Onboarding
**As a** Finance Manager  
**I want** streamlined contractor onboarding and management  
**So that** I can quickly set up new contractors and maintain accurate records for tax purposes

**Key User Stories:**
1. **Register new contractors with automatic RUT validation** - System validates RUT with SII, stores contractor info, flags invalid RUTs with clear error messages - **Priority: Critical**
2. **Manage contractor profiles and tax settings** - View/edit contractor details, set custom retention rates if applicable, track contractor status - **Priority: Critical**
3. **Import contractors from Excel/CSV** - Bulk upload existing contractor database, validate all RUTs, show import results with error handling - **Priority: High**

#### Epic 2: Boleta Processing & Tax Calculations
**As a** Finance Manager  
**I want** automated boleta processing with accurate tax calculations  
**So that** I can process payments quickly without manual calculations or SII compliance errors

**Key User Stories:**
1. **Process incoming boletas automatically** - Upload boleta PDFs or receive via email, extract key data (amount, contractor, services), validate against contractor records - **Priority: Critical**
2. **Calculate 10% tax retention automatically** - Apply correct retention rate based on contractor type, handle special cases (exento contractors), show calculation breakdown - **Priority: Critical**
3. **Generate payment authorization with tax summary** - Create payment voucher with net amount, retention amount, contractor details, ready for approval - **Priority: Critical**
4. **Handle boleta corrections and adjustments** - Process boleta corrections, adjust previous retentions, maintain audit trail of changes - **Priority: High**

#### Epic 3: SII Integration & Compliance
**As a** Finance Manager  
**I want** automated SII reporting and compliance  
**So that** I can meet monthly Form 29 deadlines without manual data entry or calculation errors

**Key User Stories:**
1. **Generate Form 29 data automatically** - Compile monthly retention data, format for SII submission, validate totals against individual boletas - **Priority: Critical**
2. **Submit Form 29 to SII electronically** - Connect with SII systems using company's digital certificate, submit monthly reports, track submission status - **Priority: High**
3. **Maintain compliance audit trail** - Log all boleta processing, retention calculations, and SII submissions for audit purposes - **Priority: Critical**

### Key Workflows
**Workflow 1: Monthly Boleta Processing**
```
Receive Boleta → Validate Contractor → Calculate Retention → Generate Payment Auth → Approve Payment → Update Records
```

**Workflow 2: Monthly SII Reporting**
```
Review Monthly Data → Generate Form 29 → Validate Totals → Submit to SII → Confirm Receipt → Archive Records
```

## Technical Approach

### High-Level Architecture
**System Components:**
- **Frontend:** React SPA integrated with existing platform UI
- **Backend:** Node.js API extending current ERP architecture
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with new contractor and boleta tables
- **Key Integrations:** SII web services, existing accounting module, PDF processing service

### Critical Technical Decisions
**Decision 1:** Extend existing platform rather than standalone app - Leverages current SII integration and customer authentication
**Decision 2:** PDF text extraction for boleta processing - Use OCR service to extract data from uploaded boleta PDFs
**Decision 3:** Real-time SII validation - Validate contractor RUTs against SII database during onboarding

### Performance & Security Basics
**Performance:** <3 second response time for boleta processing, handle 100+ concurrent boleta uploads
**Security:** Encrypt contractor PII data, secure SII API connections, audit trail for all financial transactions
**Compliance:** Maintain SOC 2 compliance, ensure SII integration meets digital certificate requirements
