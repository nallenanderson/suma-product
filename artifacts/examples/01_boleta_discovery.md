- **Owner:** John doe (Product Manager)
- **Created Date:** July 15, 2025
- **Status:** Approved

---

## Problem & Opportunity (2-Minute Summary)

**Problem Statement:** Chilean SMBs spend 4-6 hours weekly processing boletas de honorarios manually, causing payment delays, tax calculation errors, and contractor relationship issues.

**Target Customer:** SMBs with 10-50 employees that regularly hire 15+ independent contractors (construction, marketing agencies, consulting firms)

**Business Impact:** $216M CLP ARR opportunity over 18 months targeting contractor-heavy industries

**Confidence Level:** High - Strong customer validation from 8 interviews plus clear regulatory driver (10% retention compliance)

---

## Validation Evidence

### Customer Evidence (Minimum 5 interviews)
**Research Done:**
- 8 customer interviews (July 1-10, 2025)
- Current customer usage data analyzed (contractor payment patterns)
- Support ticket review (tax calculation and payment issues)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Manual Processing Pain:** 75% of customers spend 4+ hours weekly on boleta processing and payment reconciliation
2. **Tax Calculation Errors:** This costs customers on average $180,000 CLP/month in SII penalties and incorrect retentions
3. **Solution Interest:** 6 out of 8 customers would pay $50.000-80.000 CLP monthly for automation

**Best Customer Quote:**
> "Procesamos casi 100 boletas mensuales y mi contador pasa medio día solo calculando las retenciones. Los contratistas nos reclaman por los pagos tardíos, pero el proceso manual es muy lento y propenso a errores. Si tuvieras una solución la compraría hoy ahora mismo."
> - Carlos Mendoza, Gerente Financiero, Constructora del Sur (45 empleados)

### Market Reality Check
**Competitors:** Defontana (expensive, complex UI), Chipax (basic boleta generation only), Excel templates (manual, error-prone)
**Market Size:** ~15.000 SMBs in Chile regularly using contractors, growing 12% annually
**Regulatory:** SII 10% retention requirements, Form 29 monthly reporting, digital certificate compliance

## Validated Problem Definition

### Core Problem Statement
**Problem:** SMBs manually process boletas de honorarios causing delays, errors, and compliance risks

**Who Has This Problem:** Finance managers and accounting teams at SMBs hiring 15+ contractors monthly

**When/Where:** End of each month during boleta processing and payment cycles, plus ongoing contractor onboarding

**Current Impact:** 4-6 hours weekly manual work, $180K CLP monthly in potential penalties, contractor payment delays affecting relationships

###  Problem Validation Evidence
- **Quantitative Evidence:**
  - 75% of surveyed customers report significant time spent on boleta processing
  - Average time lost per week: 5 hours for finance team
  - Average cost impact: $180,000 CLP per month in penalties/errors
  - 85% of customers have sought alternative solutions (Excel macros, external accountants)

- **Qualitative Evidence:**
  - 6 customers mentioned this as their top administrative pain point
  - Consistent themes across interviews: time consumption, error risk, contractor complaints
  - Observed workflows confirm manual Excel calculations and printed payment vouchers

### Problem Prioritization
**Frequency:** Monthly (boleta processing) + ongoing (contractor onboarding and payments)

**Impact:** High business impact (regulatory compliance + contractor relationships)

**Urgency:** High (monthly SII deadlines create time pressure)

**Priority Score:** 3 × 3 × 3 = 27/27

## Business Case (One-Page)

### Revenue Opportunity
- **Target Customers:** 450 customers in Year 1 (3% of addressable market)
- **Revenue per Customer:** $40.000 CLP monthly add-on
- **Total ARR Opportunity:** $216,000,000 CLP
- **Investment Required:** $90,000,000 CLP (2 months development)
- **Payback Period:** 2 months

### Strategic Fit
**Company Goals Supported:** Revenue diversification, contractor economy growth, platform expansion beyond employees
**Roadmap Alignment:** Extends our existing payroll and compliance expertise into contractor management segment
**Competitive Advantage:** Integrated platform (vs. standalone boleta tools) with existing SII integration and customer trust

## Success Metrics & Risks

### Success Criteria
**Primary Metric:** 60% of target customers (SMBs with 15+ contractors) adopt within 90 days of feature launch
**Revenue Goal:** $216M CLP incremental ARR by December 2025
**Customer Goal:** 450 new contractor module customers or 15% improvement in platform retention

### Top 3 Risks
1. **SII Integration Complexity:** Impact: Medium - API changes or certification delays could delay launch by 2-3 months
2. **Customer Workflow Changes:** Impact: Medium - SMBs may resist changing established (manual) contractor processes
3. **Competitive Response:** Impact: Low - Established players may add similar features, but our integration advantage remains strong
