# Streamlined Product Discovery Process
*Based on First Principles - Delete, Simplify, Optimize*

---

## Core Question Framework
**Answer these 4 questions. If you can't answer all 4 clearly, don't proceed.**

1. **What problem kills our customers and how frequently?** (Daily = high priority, Weekly = medium, Monthly = low)
2. **Will customers pay us $X more immediately for solving this?** (Name the specific X)
3. **Can we solve this 10x better than alternatives?** (Not 10% - 10X)
4. **Can we build this in <12 weeks with our current team?** (If no, break it down or kill it)

## The 48-Hour Discovery Sprint

### Day 1: Problem Validation
**Morning (4 hours):**
- Call 5 customers who experience this problem
- Ask: "What's the most painful part of your day related to [problem]?"
- Ask: "What would you pay to never deal with this again?"
- Document exact quotes - no interpretation

**Afternoon (4 hours):**
- Analyze support tickets for this problem (last 90 days)
- Count frequency: How many times per day does this hit our customers?
- Calculate cost: How much money/time does this cost them?

### Day 2: Reality Check & Solution Validation
**Morning (2 hours):**
- Check if 3 competitors already solve this well
- If yes and we can't do 10x better: STOP. Delete this project.
- If no competitors OR we can dominate: Continue

**Afternoon (2 hours):**
- Write the 1-sentence problem statement
- Write the 1-sentence solution approach
- Get 3 beta customer commitments: "Will you test this in 12 weeks?"
- Estimate revenue impact in 12 months with confidence level

## Go/No-Go Decision Matrix
**GO if ALL are true:**
- [ ] 30+ customers experience this problem frequently (daily/weekly)
- [ ] Costs customers $500+ annually each OR saves 4+ hours/month
- [ ] 3+ customers committed to beta test solution
- [ ] No competitor solves this well OR we can do 10x better
- [ ] Engineering estimates <12 weeks to build MVP
- [ ] Clear path to $500K+ ARR within 18 months

**NO-GO if ANY are true:**
- [ ] Problem occurs less than weekly for most customers
- [ ] Customers won't commit to beta testing
- [ ] Strong competitor dominates with good solution
- [ ] Engineering estimates >12 weeks for MVP
- [ ] Revenue potential <$500K ARR in 18 months
- [ ] Solution requires major platform changes

## Output: The Discovery Handoff

### The Validated Problem (3 sentences max)
[Sentence 1: What breaks and how often]
[Sentence 2: Who it breaks for (specific customer segment)]  
[Sentence 3: What it costs them in time/money]

### The Proposed Solution (2 sentences max)
[Sentence 1: How we'll solve it]
[Sentence 2: Why we'll win vs alternatives]

### The Evidence (Numbers only)
- Customers affected: [X]
- Problem frequency: [Daily/Weekly/Monthly]
- Cost per customer annually: $[X] or [Y] hours/month
- Beta customers committed: [3 names]
- Engineering estimate: [X] weeks
- Competitive solutions: [X] (name them)

### The Opportunity (Bottom line up front)
- Revenue in 18 months: $[X]
- Development cost estimate: $[X]  
- Payback period: [X] months
- Confidence level: [High/Medium/Low] - [why]

### Ready for Definition Phase
- [ ] Problem validated with customers
- [ ] Solution approach identified
- [ ] Beta customers committed
- [ ] Revenue opportunity calculated

### The Decision
**SHIP IT** or **DELETE IT** - [One sentence why]

---

## Approval Process
*One person decides. No committees.*

**Decider:** [Name - Product Lead]
**Decision by:** [Date - 48 hours after sprint completion]
**If GO:** Start definition phase immediately with:
  - Problem statement
  - Solution approach
  - 3 beta customer contacts
  - Engineering timeline estimate
**If NO-GO:** Archive and move to next problem

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ **Market research documents** - Talk to customers instead
❌ **Avoid Stakeholder Opinions** - Talk to customers instead
❌ **Competitive analysis matrices** - Use the product instead  
❌ **Stakeholder alignment meetings** - Data decides, not committees
❌ **Prioritization frameworks** - Revenue and customer pain decide
❌ **Phase gates and approvals** - Ship or don't ship

## Success Metric
**Only one matters:** Revenue from this solution in 3 months

*Everything else is vanity metrics.*
